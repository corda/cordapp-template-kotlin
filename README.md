# CorDapp Template - Kotlin

Welcome to the Kotlin CorDapp template. The CorDapp template is a stubbed-out CorDapp that you can use to bootstrap 
your own CorDapps.

**This is the Kotlin version of the CorDapp template. The Java equivalent is 
[here](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-java/).**

# Pre-Requisites

See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.

# Usage

## Running tests inside IntelliJ

We recommend editing your IntelliJ preferences so that you use the gradle runner - this means that the quasar utils 
plugin will make sure that these flags are set for you.

Currently in `Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner` (but just search for `runner`)

 * set "Delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle" to true
 * set "Run test using:" to "Gradle Test Runner"

Alternatively, you can:

 * copy your quasar.jar to the `<project root>/lib/` dir
 * for each test specify `-javaagent:lib/quasar.jar` and setting the run directory to the project root directory

## Running the nodes

See https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#running-the-example-cordapp.

## Interacting with the nodes

### Shell

When started via the command line, each node will display an interactive shell:

    Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
    Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.
    
    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>>

You can use this shell to interact with your node. For example, enter `run networkMapSnapshot` to see a list of 
the other nodes on the network:

    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>> run networkMapSnapshot
    [
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10002" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=Notary, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505484825
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10005" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyA, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505382560
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10008" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyB, L=New York, C=US" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505384742
    }
    ]
    
    Tue Nov 06 12:30:11 GMT 2018>>> 

You can find out more about the node shell [here](https://docs.corda.net/shell.html).

### Client

`clients/src/main/kotlin/com/template/Client.kt` defines a simple command-line client that connects to a node via RPC 
and prints a list of the other nodes on the network.

#### Running the client

##### Via the command line

Run the `runTemplateClient` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Template Client` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`.

### Webserver

`clients/src/main/kotlin/com/template/webserver/` defines a simple Spring webserver that connects to a node via RPC and 
allows you to interact with the node over HTTP.

The API endpoints are defined here:

     clients/src/main/kotlin/com/template/webserver/Controller.kt

And a static webpage is defined here:

     clients/src/main/resources/static/

#### Running the webserver

##### Via the command line

Run the `runTemplateServer` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Template Server` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

#### Interacting with the webserver

The static webpage is served on:

    http://localhost:10050

While the sole template endpoint is served on:

    http://localhost:10050/templateendpoint
    
# Extending the template

You should extend this template as follows:

* Add your own state and contract definitions under `contracts/src/main/kotlin/`
* Add your own flow definitions under `workflows/src/main/kotlin/`
* Extend or replace the client and webserver under `clients/src/main/kotlin/`

For a guided example of how to extend this template, see the Hello, World! tutorial 
[here](https://docs.corda.net/hello-world-introduction.html).
